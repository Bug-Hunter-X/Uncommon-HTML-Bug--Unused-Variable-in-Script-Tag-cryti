This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to unused variables declared within a script tag. The bug involves a variable defined inside a script tag but never utilized within the script itself.  While not causing runtime errors in most cases, this can lead to code bloat, affect code readability, and potentially trigger warnings from linters or issues during minification. The solution involves removing or using the unused variable.
